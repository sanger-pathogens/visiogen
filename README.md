**Visiogen** is a high-performance tool for producing probes using **kmers** from genomic annotations/graphs. It supports GFF-based gene input, graph-based input, and kmer indexing with customizable filtering using the CBL libary.

Check out [CBL](https://github.com/imartayan/CBL/tree/main) for more details.

## üîß Features

* Generate probes from GFA graphs or GFF files
* Filter kmers based on GC content, center base, or other sequence characteristics
* Build off target kmer indexes from FASTA inputs
* Query kmers against index files to assess off-target risk

---

## üöÄ Installation

You‚Äôll need:

* Rust toolchain (`nightly-2024-05-31`)
* System dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt install -y libstdc++-12-dev libclang-dev
```

then after cloning the repo you can build with

```bash
RUN cargo +nightly-2024-05-31 build --release
```

### üê≥ Docker

Two Dockerfiles are provided:

* **Ubuntu 22.04**: `Dockerfile`
* **Ubuntu 20.04**: `Dockerfile-ubuntu-20`

Build example:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile -t visiogen .
```
---

## üß¨ Example Usage

### üîπ GFF Mode: Extract kmers from specific genes

```bash
visiogen gff -f input.fa -a annotation.gff -g gene1,gene2,gene3
```

### üîπ Graph Mode: Generate probes from a GFA assembly graph

```bash
visiogen graph -g graph.gfa -t 0.95
```

### üîπ Build Mode: Index FASTA files for off-target querying

```bash
visiogen build -i fasta_dir
```

### üîπ After indexing the fasta_dir you can use it as an off target database

```bash
visiogen graph -g graph.gfa -t 0.95 -i fasta_dir
```

## üì¶ Subcommands

### `gff`

Extract kmers from a genome FASTA using GFF annotation.

Required:

* `-f <FASTA>`: Genome sequence
* `-a <GFF>`: Gene annotation
* `-g <genes>`: Comma-separated list of gene IDs

### `build`

Create `.cbl` kmer index files from a directory of FASTA files.

Optional:

* `-c, --canonical`: Use canonical kmers (default: true)

### `graph`

Generate kmers from a GFA-format assembly graph.

* `-g <GFA>`: Path to `.gfa` graph
* `-t <threshold>`: Core segment threshold (default: 0.95)

---

## üì§ Output

### Each kmer is tracked with:

* Associated gene, strand, and coordinates
* Presence/absence in index files (off-targets)
* Filtering status based on GC content, hits, etc.

### Logging reports:

* Which kmers were found in which indexes
* Which were discarded due to too many hits
* Which were missing from all indexes

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

Planned features and improvements:

### Graph Mode Enhancements
Stricter support thresholds: Link segment inclusion thresholds to actual strain support.
Bubble resolution: Interpret graph bubbles as SNPs or structural variation to increase number of usable segments.
Annotation: Support importing annotations from a reference genome and adding to the graph.

### üßπ Logging & UX
Improved logging: Reduce verbosity and group messages.

### üóÉÔ∏è Indexing Improvements
Single-file index format: Consolidate multiple .cbl files into a unified index.

### ü¶Ä Rust & Build System
Migrate from nightly toolchain to stable Rust once key dependencies allow/are changed.

Offer precompiled binaries or automated builds for common platforms (e.g., Linux, macOS).

## üì´ Feedback / Contributions

Issues welcome! This was a learning project for me and any feedback or ideas are welcome üòä

> **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:** Always manually BLAST the selected probes before ordering them to verify specificity and avoid off-target binding.
